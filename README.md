# Executive Summary
Congestive Heart Failure Blood Flow Model for Patients and Medical Students
William Bowers, Katelyn Fry, Julianna Gonzalez, Zachary Lyons, Amaia Modolo

The students in Dream Team Engineering have designed a SolidWorks-based congestive heart failure (CHF) model that illustrates the effects of coronary artery disease (CAD) on blood flow. CHF is a condition in which the heart cannot pump blood efficiently to meet the body's needs. CHF can result from various factors, including ischemic heart disease, which occurs when there is reduced blood flow to the cardiac muscle. This reduced blood flow is typically caused by plaque buildup in the coronary arteries, a condition known as CAD. Chronic CHF may lead to fluid buildup in the heart, lungs, liver, and kidneys, increasing the risk of hypertension, heart valve diseases, or sudden cardiac arrest.
The goal of the project is to create a tool that helps physicians educate patients about CAD and how it can lead to blood congestion in the heart, altering blood flow. Using SolidWorks, the team modeled a healthy heart that can be used with the Fluid Flow Simulation feature (Fig. 1). Additionally, the project includes detailed models of healthy and narrowed right coronary arteries, simulating blood flow during points of gas exchange (Fig. 2). The simulation allows medical residents to modify fluid flow parameters to explore different CHF-related conditions. These four models can be 3D printed using TPU, a flexible material, to create a handheld device that can be squeezed to replicate heartbeats, with an injection point for introducing liquid at varying velocities. A drawing was also created to help patients visualize the anatomical relationship between the heart and coronary arteries, aiding physicians in explaining CAD and CHF (Fig. 3 and 4).

The team's inspiration for this project stemmed from a desire to explore SolidWorks add-ins and challenge themselves to create a functional model that could be used as both an online simulation and a physical tool for patient education. In the future, the team aims to 3D print the heart and develop a more detailed physical simulation of normal and reduced fluid flow, with the added goal of modeling the heart's beating more accurately.
